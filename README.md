# ai_expert
Repository showcasing my journey to becoming an AI expert, featuring course projects, experiments, and portfolio work. Explore hands-on AI/ML implementations, research experiments, and personal projects that demonstrate my growth and expertise in the field.

My goal is to complete 10,000 hours of study, inspired by the book **So Good They Can't Ignore You**. Not all of my work will be in this repository, as I also spend time taking handwritten notes, but I'll do my best to upload as much material as possible to help others on their journey into the world of artificial intelligence.
